		   <li>Blood makes up about 7 percent of your body's weight.</li>
		   <li>There are four types of transfusable products that can be derived from blood: red cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate. Typically, two or three of these are produced from a unit of donated whole blood – hence each donation can help save up to three lives.</li>
		   <li>Every year our nation requires about 5 Crore units of blood, out of which only a meager 2.5 Crore units of blood are available.</li>
		   <li>More than 38,000 blood donations are needed every day.</li>
		   <li>A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 units of blood.</li>
		   <li>Sickle cell patients can require frequent blood transfusions throughout their lives.</li>
		   <li>If you began donating blood at age 18 and donated every 90 days until you reached 60, you would have donated 30 gallons of blood, potentially helping save more than 500 lives!</li>
		   <li>Someone needs a blood transfusion every two seconds.</li>
			<li>Donated blood expires in 42 days.</li>
			<li>Donated platelets expire in 5 days.</li>
			<li>One pint of blood can help save up to 3 lives.</li>
			
			<li>On average, 45 units of blood are used for trauma-related injuries.</li>
			<li>Children being treated for cancer, premature infants and children having heart surgery need blood and platelets from donors of all types, especially type O.</li>
			 <li>Anemic patients need blood transfusions to increase their red blood cell levels.</li>
<li> Cancer, transplant and trauma patients, and patients undergoing open-heart surgery may require platelet transfusions to survive.</li>
<li> 17 percent of non-donors cite “never thought about it” as the main reason for not giving, while 15 percent say they’re too busy.</li>
<li>. The #1 reason blood donors say they give is because they “want to help others.”</li>
<li> Shortages of all blood types happen during the summer and winter holidays.</li>
<li> Blood centers often run short of types O and B red blood cells.</li>
<li> The rarest blood type is the one not on the shelf when it’s needed by a patient.</li>
<li> If all blood donors gave three times a year, blood shortages would be a rare event (The current average is about two.).</li>

<li> Four easy steps to donate blood: medical history, quick physical, donation and snacks.</li>
<li> The actual blood donation usually takes about 10 minutes. The entire process – from the time you sign in to the time you leave – takes about an hour.</li>
<li> After donating blood, you replace the fluid in hours and the red blood cells within four weeks. It takes eight weeks to restore the iron lost after donating.</li>
<li> Giving blood will not decrease your strength.</li>
<li> Any company, community organization, place of worship or individual may contact their local community blood center to host a blood drive.</li>
<li> Blood drives hosted by companies, schools, places of worship and civic organizations supply roughly half of all blood donations across the US.</li>
<li> People who donate blood are volunteers and are not paid for their donation.</li>
<li> Blood donation. It’s about an hour of your time. It’s About Life.</li>
